 * (?key= query param / x-admin-key header — old booking emails link to
 * /admin?key=<token> and must keep working). Anything else gets a 401 with
 * a WWW-Authenticate challenge so the browser shows its native login prompt.
 *
 * The routes themselves re-check credentials (defense in depth) — this layer
 * exists so the *page* can answer 401+challenge, which a server component
