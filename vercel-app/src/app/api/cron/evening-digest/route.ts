/**
 * 20:00-Cairo evening digest — GET, triggered by the GitHub Actions workflow
 * .github/workflows/cron-evening-digest.yml (Vercel Hobby's 2-cron cap is
 * fully used by the daily brief, so all fleet jobs ride GitHub cron).
 *
 * Auth: Bearer CRON_SECRET, fail closed (same contract as the daily brief).
 *
 * DST-proofing: the workflow fires at BOTH 17:00 and 18:00 UTC; this guard
 * only proceeds when the Africa/Cairo hour is exactly 20 — normally one
 * firing sends and the other returns {skipped}. The hour guard alone is not
 * airtight (60-minute-plus Actions delays can land both firings in the
 * window; a prod workflow_dispatch passes it too), so a non-empty digest
 * also claims a per-day marker before sending (claimDailySend). `?force=1`
 * bypasses the guard outside production only.
 *
 * Content: tomorrow's confirmed appointments + pending requests waiting
 * 12h+ + orders stuck in "ordered" 48h+ (see @/lib/reports/evening-digest).
 *
 * EMPTY STATE: skipped entirely — no Telegram, no email. The morning brief
 * is the guaranteed daily heartbeat; the evening digest only speaks when
 * something actually needs the owner, so it never trains her to ignore it.
 * (Exception: data-source failures still send, with a warning — documented
 * in the builder.)
