/**
 * Proactive Telegram pushes to the bound owner chat: new shop orders and
 * low-stock alerts — each with one-tap action buttons where it makes sense.
 * (The original studio also pushed booking requests; Just Manalized has no
 * bookings, so those pushes were removed.)
 *
 * Contract (every export):
 * - STRICTLY BEST EFFORT. Nothing here may ever fail the calling flow — a
 *   Telegram outage, a Blob hiccup or a corrupt owner record must not break
 *   a booking webhook or a client's order. Every entry point catches and
 *   logs; none of them throw.
 * - Silent no-op when TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is unset or no owner is bound.
 *   Note the deliberate asymmetry with the webhook route: there a corrupt
 *   owner record fails CLOSED (security boundary); here it just means "no
 *   push today" (pure convenience, nothing is exposed or executed).
 *
 * One-tap actions REUSE the existing confirmation machinery end to end: each
 * button is a pending action on Blob (validateMutationArgs → describeMutation
 * → createPendingAction) and its callback_data is `confirm:<id>` — exactly
 * what the Telegram webhook's callback handler executes, with the same
 * atomic exactly-once claims, owner-only checks and audit trail. The pushed
 * button itself IS the confirmation step (Victoria's tap = approval),
 * consistent with the chat flow where the inline keyboard is the gate.
 * Pushed pendings use NOTIFY_PENDING_TTL_MS (7 days) — Victoria may tap a
 * notification button hours later; the 15-minute chat default would kill it.
 *
 * Language: notifications are EN (Victoria's admin/notification surfaces are
 * EN throughout); client names, treatments and product names interpolate
 * with control characters stripped (see pushSafe) but otherwise as-is, so
 * Russian content renders naturally.
