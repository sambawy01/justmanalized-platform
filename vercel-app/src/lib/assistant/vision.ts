/**
 * Photo / vision understanding for Vassili.
 *
 * TWO-STAGE design (chosen empirically — see decision note below):
 *   Stage 1 (HERE): a multimodal model TRIAGES + EXTRACTS the photo into
 *     structured JSON — { kind, vendor, total, date, category, productName,
 *     productDesc, text } plus a hard skin-assessment refusal flag.
 *   Stage 2 (webhook): for a receipt/product we synthesize a plain-language
 *     instruction and run it through the EXISTING text agent + tools, so the
 *     mutating action (log_expense / product_add) parks behind Victoria's
 *     unchanged [Confirm | Cancel] gate. Nothing mutating ever executes from a
 *     photo without her tap.
 *
 * WHY two-stage (not let the vision model tool-call directly): the agent's
 * native tool-calling is proven only on the deepseek text models; the cloud
 * multimodal models (gemini-3-flash-preview / gemma3:27b) emit clean,
 * reliable JSON in probes but their tool_call support is unproven on this
 * account. Extracting JSON then handing it to the proven text-agent gate is
 * the robust path AND reuses every existing validation / disclosure / confirm
 * guarantee unchanged. Model: gemini-3-flash-preview (see visionModel()) —
 * lower latency than gemma3:27b on the same probes (~3–5s vs ~6–9s, which
 * matters because a second text-agent round follows under the webhook
 * deadline) with comparable extraction and correct skin-assessment refusal.
 *
 * CRITICAL GUARDRAIL — NO SKIN / FACE ASSESSMENT. Vassili must REFUSE to
 * analyze a person's face or skin for any cosmetic / medical / treatment
 * assessment ("what treatment does her skin need", "analyze my wrinkles").
 * Victoria's professional eye is the product; an AI skin diagnosis is both
 * off-brand and a medical-advice risk. This is enforced in FIVE layers:
 *   1. the extraction system prompt instructs the model to classify any such
 *      request as kind "skin_assessment" with refuse=true and give NO advice;
 *   2. a code-level caption check (skinAssessmentIntent) forces refusal even if
 *      the model misclassifies — defense in depth;
 *   3. analyzePhoto returns the polite refusal + a booking suggestion and NEVER
 *      reaches the agent/tools for that case;
 *   4. face presence is classified INDEPENDENTLY of intent (facePresent): the
 *      moment any human face/skin is visibly the subject we refuse, REGARDLESS
 *      of kind — so an innocent/no caption ("describe this image") on a real
 *      face photo can never be relayed as a description of a person's skin even
 *      if the model misclassifies the request as "general";
 *   5. a belt-and-suspenders keyword scrub (EN+RU) over the model's free-text
 *      before relaying a "general" read — if it mentions skin/face/complexion/
 *      wrinkles/etc. we refuse instead of relaying.
 * Legitimate ops photos (receipts, product jars, documents) are unaffected
 * (facePresent is false and their text carries no skin/face vocabulary).

  return `You are the image-triage and extraction step for Vassili, the private ops assistant of a women's holistic beauty studio in Egypt. You receive ONE image plus an optional caption from the studio owner. Classify it and extract structured data. Respond with ONLY a single JSON object — no prose, no markdown fences.

Choose exactly one "kind":
- "receipt": a receipt, invoice or proof of a business expense/purchase.
- "product": a retail skincare/beauty PRODUCT (a jar, bottle, box) the owner wants to add to her shop.
- "general": the owner wants you to read, transcribe, translate or plainly describe what's in the image (a document, a note, a label).
- "skin_assessment": ANY request — by caption OR implied by a photo of a person's face/skin — to assess, diagnose, rate, or recommend treatment for someone's face, skin, wrinkles, acne, complexion or the like.

ABSOLUTE RULE: if kind is "skin_assessment" you MUST set "refuse": true and give NO skin/face/treatment assessment, observation or advice of any kind — not even a hint. Skin reading is the human esthetician's job, never the AI's. When unsure whether a face photo is an assessment request, prefer "skin_assessment" + refuse.

SEPARATELY, set "face_present": true if ANY human face or human skin is visibly the subject of the image — a portrait, selfie, close-up of skin, or any photo where a person's face/skin is the main thing shown — REGARDLESS of the caption or what is being asked, and EVEN IF you classified kind as "general" (e.g. "describe this image"). Set it false for receipts, product packaging, documents, text, objects, scenery, or images with no person as the subject. A small incidental person in the background of an object/scene photo is NOT the subject — set false. When in doubt about a face/skin close-up, set true.

For "receipt", extract: vendor (string), total_egp (number, the grand total in EGP), date (YYYY-MM-DD or ""), category (best guess, ONE of: ${EXPENSE_CATEGORIES.join(", ")}), method (how paid: one of cash, bank-transfer, card, other; "" if unknown).
For "product", extract: product_name (the product's name in English) and product_desc (a short one-line description, e.g. type + size).
For "general", put the read/translated/described text in "text".

JSON shape (use null/"" for fields that don't apply):
{"kind":"receipt|product|general|skin_assessment","refuse":false,"face_present":false,"vendor":"","total_egp":null,"date":"","category":"","method":"","product_name":"","product_desc":"","text":""}`;
